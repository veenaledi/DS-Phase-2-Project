### Business Understanding
*__The Problem__:* The company is establishing a new movie studio to expand into original content production. An analysis of current box office trends is underway to identify high-performing film genres and translate these findings into strategic creative direction.

*__Objectives__:* The primary business goal is to maximize profitability while minimizing financial risk in the highly competitive film industry.

*__Success Criteria__:* Determine optimal budget allocation strategies. Achieve 15-20% profit margins on initial film releases.

## Data Understanding
**Data sets used**:[tmdb.movies.csv.gz] - Contains movie data including genres, release dates, and ratings
[tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz] - Contains production budgets and worldwide gross revenue data

**Reasons for data selection**:
- Valid production budget values
- Complete budget and revenue information
- Release dates within analysis timeframe  

**Data Description**
1. *TMDB Dataset:*
- Records: ~26,000 movies
- Key Variables: title, genres, release_date, popularity, vote_average
- Time Period: 1960-2020

2. *TN Dataset:*
- Records: ~5,000 movies
- Key Variables: movie, production_budget, domestic_gross, worldwide_gross
- Time Period: 2010-2019

**Outliers**: 
- Present in budget and revenue data (blockbuster films)
- I decided to keep Outliers since they are a vital part of the analysis.

**Merged Data**:
- Data was merged using inner join to the id column then duplicates were removed from the title column.
- It is easier to analyze a smaller dataset rather than a large dataset with multiple empty spaces. 

### Data Preparation
1. __*Data Cleaning*__
- Decompression of .csv.gz files

- Removal of duplicates and missing values

- Currency formatting applied to relevant budget and revenue fields

- Outliers were kept for better and accurate analysis

- Conversion of dates and runtime fields to standardized formats

- Removal of unnesessary columns to make merging easier

2. __*Added Calculated Columns*__
- profit = worldwide_gross - production_budget
- roi = (profit / production_budget) Ã— 100

### Modeling
__Visual Data Analysis:__
- Production Budget vs Worldwide Gross Revenue scatter plots
- Average Movie Gross Revenue by Release Year
- Top 15 Movies by Return on Investment
- Average Domestic vs International Revenue
- Top 20 Highest Grossing Movies Worldwide
- Seasonal Release Patterns
- Budget Ranges and Success Rates
- Top Performances: High Budget vs Low Budget Success Charts
- Vote Average vs Box Office Performance

### Evaluation
1. Holiday (Nov-Dec): Strong performance for family-friendly content.
2. Summer (May-Aug): 35% higher average gross than other seasons
3. Analysis based on past performance may not predict future trends
4. Streaming services impact not fully captured

## Key Findings
1. High-budget films (>$100M) can achieve massive returns but carry significant financial risk
2. Low-budget productions (<$10M) can yield extraordinary return of investment percentages
3. Summer releases (May-August) show higher average gross revenue
4. Original content requires careful genre selection and budget management

## Reccomendations 
1. Plan major releases for summer and holiday windows
2. Use smaller films to test audience response before major franchise investments
3. Develop franchise-ready content with sequel and merchandising potential
4. Reserve high budgets (>$100M) only for franchise properties with strong IP foundation
5. Coordinate marketing spend with budget tier - allocate 50-60% of production budget for marketing on high-budget films
6. Consider international appeal in script development and casting decisions
